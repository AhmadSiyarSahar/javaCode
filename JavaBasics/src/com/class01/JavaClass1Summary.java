//		 Variables:
//		 Data Type: Any data we insert to Java, we must:
//		 First identify to Java its type, second its name and lastly its value.
//		 Data Types: 1- Primitive 2- Non-primitive
//		 1. Primitive:
//		 A- (Byte, Short, Integers and Long) Just for numbers.< integers mostly used>
//		 B- (Float and Double) Just for decimal numbers. <<double mostly used> When we use float, 
//		we should put f at the end of the variable. 
//		 C- (Char) Just for a character and should be used in ''. 'A', '$'
//		 D- Boolean Just for true or false questions.
//		 2. Non-primitive:
//		 String is used for combination of characters, numbers, special characters.
//		 The first letter of String must be in upper case and its value must be
//		 written in "".
//		 Formula for entering variables: DataType name=value;
//		 To format= Ctrl+Shift+f
